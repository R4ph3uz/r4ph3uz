# Hi everyone 👋

<!-- It's nice to look at this code but look at the code of my other repositories instead 😀 -->

## Who am I ?

I'm a french student, passionate about new technologies since my earliest childhood, computer science especially attracted me.
I learn all these things on my own (with help of the Internet :smile:).

## What I am currently doing (coding? 😅)

- 🐍 But I'm also working on easy scripts in Python or bash/shell to simplify my life.
- 💻 I always want my Linux to be perfect, so I constantly try to improve it.
- 🏴‍☠️ I'm creating new skills in ethical hacking using [root-me](https://www.root-me.org/R4ph3uz) (or see below).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things :

    - Advanced Python Programming
    - Advanced CSS skills 
    - JS skills and JS framework
